# Honors Portfolio

I created this portfolio as one of my final requirements to graduate with Interdisciplinary Honors at the University of Washington.  My Honors Portfolio is a story of my time at UW. From personal to professional to academic, I share how I've changed throughout the process. Enjoy.

# Creation

I created a bare-bones outline of this portfolio, and then go in with continual iterations to make this site better.

I decided to code this website, as opposed to using a website builder, to sharpen my technical skills.

Tools & technologies used: HTML, CSS, VS Code, Git, GitHub
