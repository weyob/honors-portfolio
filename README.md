# Honors Portfolio

I created this portfolio as one of my final requirements to graduate with Interdisciplinary Honors at the University of Washington.  My Honors Portfolio is a story of my time at UW. From personal to professional to academic, I share how I've changed throughout the process. Enjoy.

# Creation

I created a bare-bones outline of this portfolio, and then am going in with continual iterations to make this site better.

I decided to code this website, as opposed to using a website builder, to sharpen my technical skills.

# Challenges

- I'm struggling to properly format the pic of UW on my home page. It keeps running off the right side of the page. I think the image width is bigger than the width of the page
    - I've tried reducing the width
        - This resulted in the picture fitting on the page, but not taking up the width of the page
